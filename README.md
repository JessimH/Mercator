## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

As a student in Web & Mobile Development at [Webstart](https://ecole-webstart.com/) I had to create for my end of year project an e-commerce with the theme of my choice. So I decided to create a platform for buying and selling football players, this site would aim to facilitate the transfer system already present in football. I built an admin that can add, modify or delete clubs and users as well as a connection system (reserved for club managers) that allows them to add, modify, delete players from the mercato. Feel free to download it on your machines and test it! 

### Prerequisites

To test it, install the sql file in your database, and activate Mamp or Wamp in order to simulate a server that will be able to read the PHP and display the site:

* [MAMP/WAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/)
* [PhpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/)


### Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
